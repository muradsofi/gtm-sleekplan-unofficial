# Sleekplan Tag (unofficial)

This repository contains an unofficial Google Tag Manager template for integrating the Sleekplan feedback widget. Since Sleekplan doesn’t offer an official GTM template, this community-supported solution lets you load the widget, update user data, and add metadata.

## Features

- **Widget Load:** Loads the Sleekplan widget using your API key.
- **Set User:** Updates user data via configurable table fields.
- **Add Metadata:** Adds metadata using configurable table fields.
- Multi-language support for field labels and help text.

## Installation

1. Export the template from this repository (`template.tpl`).
2. Import it into your Google Tag Manager container as a custom template.
3. Configure the fields as needed.
4. Publish your container.
